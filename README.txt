EmotiveCuts Link-in-Bio - Final Package
Files included:
- index.html      (main page)
- logo.png        (your golden logo)
Notes:
- index.html references an external soft piano audio file (Pixabay). If you prefer local hosting, replace the <audio> source in index.html with "./music.mp3" and place the music file in the same folder.
- To preview: extract the ZIP and double-click index.html (it will open in your browser).
- To host:
  * GitHub Pages: create a new repo, upload all files to root, enable Pages from main branch -> root.
  * Netlify: drag & drop the folder into Netlify Drop.
  * Carrd: use custom HTML block or recreate visually.
- If you want me to host the audio locally inside the ZIP (music.mp3), upload the mp3 file here or provide a public URL I can fetch.
- Replace button '#' hrefs in index.html with your actual links (YouTube, portfolio, WhatsApp, Instagram) before publishing.
- Footer contains: © 2025 EmotiveCuts | Crafted with ❤️ by Chandan

Enjoy — open index.html to preview!
